1. **AWS Pricing:** AWS offers you a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for the vast majority of our cloud services. With AWS you pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as you use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. AWS pricing is similar to how you pay for utilities like water and electricity. You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees.

1. **On Demand Instance:** This is the default, pay as you go pricing model. When you use resources (for example, EC2 instances or services such as DynamoDB on demand) you pay a flat rate, and you have no long-term commitments. You can increase or decrease the capacity of your resources or services based on the demands of your application. On-Demand has an hourly rate, but depending on the service, can be billed in increments of one second (for example Amazon RDS, or Linux EC2 instances).

   Though Instance/Upfront cost remains same, Spot is slightly costlier than On-demand monthly

1. **Spot Instance :** A Spot Instance is spare Amazon EC2 compute capacity available at discounts of up to 90% off On-Demand prices with no long-term commitment required. With Spot Instances, you can significantly reduce the cost of running your applications or scale your application’s compute capacity for the same budget.

 

1. **Reserved Instances/Commitment:** Similar to Savings Plans, Reserved Instances (RI) offer discounts up to 72% for a commitment to running a minimum amount of resources. Reserved Instances are available for Amazon RDS, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon Redshift, and DynamoDB. Reserved Instances offer the same pricing options of no upfront, partial upfront, and all upfront, and the same terms of one or three years.

   Reserved Instances can be purchased in a Region or a specific Availability Zone. They provide a capacity reservation when purchased in an Availability Zone.

   Amazon EC2 features convertible RIs, however, Savings Plans should be used for all EC2 instances due to increased flexibility and reduced operational costs.


1. **Savings Plans:** AWS provides a number of ways for you to reduce your costs by reserving or committing to use a certain amount of resources, and receiving a discounted rate for your resources. A Savings Plan allows you to make an hourly spend commitment for one or three years, and receive discounted pricing across your resources. Savings Plans provide discounts for AWS Compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda. When you make the commitment, you pay that commitment amount every hour, and it is subtracted from your On-Demand usage at the discount rate.

1. **Reserved Instance in Saving Plan:** Monthly Cost is almost halved and instance is reserved for 1/3 years
